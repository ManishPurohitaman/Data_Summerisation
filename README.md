# Data_Summerisation using NLP
NLP(Natural Language Processing) 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence and linguistics that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It involves the development and application of computational techniques to analyze, understand, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful.

NLP encompasses a wide range of tasks and applications, including:

1. Text Classification: Categorizing text into predefined classes or categories.
2. Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying and classifying named entities such as names, locations, organizations, etc. in text.
3. Sentiment Analysis: Determining the sentiment or opinion expressed in a piece of text (positive, negative, neutral).
4. Machine Translation: Translating text from one language to another.
5. Text Summarization: Generating a concise summary of a longer text.
6. Question Answering: Automatically answering questions posed in natural language.
7. Chatbots: Creating conversational agents that can understand and respond to user queries.
8. Language Generation: Generating human-like text or dialogue.

NLP utilizes various techniques and methodologies from fields such as linguistics, machine learning, statistics, and computer science. It involves tasks like tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, syntactic and semantic parsing, named entity recognition, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms.

NLP has numerous real-world applications, including information retrieval, customer support, content analysis, sentiment analysis, automated content generation, language translation, and many more. It plays a crucial role in enabling machines to understand, interpret, and interact with human language, facilitating communication between humans and computers in a more natural and efficient manner.
